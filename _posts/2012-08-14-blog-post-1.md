## Introduction
__Boost.Real__ is a C++17 library which aims at developing numerical data-type for real number representation. The library provides the flexibility of performing __arbitrary-precision__ __arithmetic__. The foundational work was done by __Laouen__ __belloli__ in GSoC'18, after that, several improvements and new additions were made in GSoC'19 by Sagnik Dey and Kimberly Swanson. For GSoC'20, I and Vikram Chundawat were selected to finish the details and add few functionalities and hence make the library review-ready. Since Vikram and mine's proposal had several overlaps, we distributed the work among ourselves. After the distribution, I got following tasks: <br>
- Changing internal base of Boost.Real numbers to a more efficient value.
- Implementation of optimized long division algorithm.
- Implementation of division operator.
- Implementation of integral power operation.
- Implementation of method to evaluate Pi digits.
- Implementaion of % operator.
- Implementation of Karatsuba Multiplication algorithm.
- Implementation of tests and documentation.  <br>
Before the start of official coding period, we decided on not changing the base of the internal representation as changing it would make few operations more expensive resulting in poor performance.

## Phase 1

__Milestones:__<br>
- Implementation of long division algorithm.
- Implementation of division operator.
- Implementation of integral power operation.
- Adding tests and documentation.

### Long division algorithm
Long division was already implemented in the library for base 10, since it was required for the purpose of base change. I had to implement it for any general base as I was going to need it while implementing % operator.  
I used Knuth's long division algorithm as it is quite efficient and easy to implement as well. The Knuth's algorithm optimizes the part where we search for quotient digit (can be anything between 0 to base - 1) in the traditional algorithm. In the traditional algorithm, the search is performed linearly from 0 to Base - 1 making the complexity O(base) (a naive optimization would be to use binary search) whereas the Knuth's algorithm does this in constant time, which provides significant optimization as our internal base increases (our internal base can go upto 10<sup>18</sup>).
