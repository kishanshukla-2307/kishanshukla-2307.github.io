## Introduction
Boost.Real is a C++17 library which aims at developing numerical data-type for real number representation. The library provides the flexibility of performing __arbitrary-precision__ __arithmetic__. The foundational work was done by __Laouen__ __belloli__ in GSoC'18, after that, several improvements and new additions were made in GSoC'19 by Sagnik Dey and Kimberly Swanson. For GSoC'20, I and Vikram Chundawat were selected to finish the details and add few functionalities and hence make the library review-ready. Since Vikram and mine's proposal had several overlaps, we distributed the work among ourselves. After the distribution, I got following tasks:
	- Changing internal base of Boost.Real numbers to a more efficient value.
	- Implementation of optimized long division algorithm.
	- Implementation of division operator.
	- Implementation of integral power operation.
	- Implementation of method to evaluate Pi digits.
	- Implementation of Karatsuba Multiplication algorithm.
	- Implementation of tests and documentation.
Before the start of official coding period, we decided on not changing the base of the internal representation as changing it would make few operations more expensive resulting in poor performance.

## Phase 1

__Milestones:__<br>
	- Implementation of long division algorithm. <br>
	- Implementation of division operator. <br>
	- Implementation of integral power operation. <br>
	- Adding tests and documentation <br>
